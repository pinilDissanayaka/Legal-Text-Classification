# Legal-Text-Classification

## Overview:
Our legal text classification project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras to analyze a comprehensive dataset of 25,000 legal cases in the form of text documents. This project is aimed at automating the process of understanding and categorizing legal documents, making it an invaluable tool for legal professionals, researchers, and the broader legal community.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset employed in this legal text classification project is a rich collection of legal cases, encompassing various aspects of the legal domain. Each of the 25,000 text documents in the dataset has been meticulously annotated, offering valuable insights into the content and context of the cases. Key attributes of the dataset include:

1. Text Documents: The dataset consists of 25,000 legal text documents, each representing a unique legal case. These documents are diverse in their content and originate from various legal domains.

2. Catchphrases: Each text document in the dataset has been annotated with relevant catchphrases. These catchphrases provide succinct summaries of the key themes or issues addressed within the legal case, facilitating quick comprehension.

3. Citation Sentences: The dataset includes citations within the legal documents, which are explicitly marked. These citations often refer to previous legal cases, statutes, or other legal resources. These citation sentences play a crucial role in understanding the legal context and precedents.

4. Citation Catchphrases: Just as catchphrases are used to summarize the main themes of a legal document, citation catchphrases provide a summary of the cited legal sources or cases. These are vital in tracking the references and influence of previous cases on the present one.

5. Citation Classes: The dataset also incorporates citation classes, which classify the type of treatment given to the cases cited within the legal document. This categorization is essential in understanding how a particular case relates to and affects the interpretation of previously decided cases.

## Deep Learning Framework:
Our project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras, two powerful deep learning frameworks, to build and train a text classification model. This model is designed to predict and categorize the citation classes based on the textual content of the legal documents, catchphrases, citation sentences, and citation catchphrases.

## Objectives:
The primary objectives of this legal text classification project are:

1. Automated Classification: Develop a robust machine learning model that can automatically categorize legal documents into citation classes based on their textual content, catchphrases, citation sentences, and citation catchphrases.

2. Legal Research Aid: Create a valuable tool that can assist legal professionals, scholars, and researchers in quickly identifying and classifying legal cases, thereby saving time and improving efficiency in legal research.

3. Precedent Analysis: Facilitate in-depth analysis of legal precedents by tracking the type of treatment given to cited cases, allowing users to better understand the legal impact of specific cases.

By harnessing the power of deep learning and utilizing the comprehensive legal dataset, our legal text classification project aims to streamline legal research and improve the understanding of legal cases, ultimately contributing to more informed legal decision-making and scholarship.
